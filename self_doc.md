# Steps taken

- First had Claude reorganize provided tasks in order of system impact and dependency

- Completed UI-101 as exploratory issue but also as means of fixing up UI so we can see text to test properly.
    - added tailwind conventional `dark:` variant pattern to existing text bodies
    - there is a more code efficient method of doing this, however, in order to follow convention and have a better time debugging in the future, we'll go with this implemented approach
